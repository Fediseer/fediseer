## GUI

You can find the official GUI at [gui.fediseer.com](https://gui.fediseer.com/)

## Scope

This Fediseer is focused around anti-spam verification. We make no judgement on the content of the guaranteed communities other than they have been verified to not be fake spam instances and are making a good effort to block spam accounts.

However using the endorsement system, you can create a further customized whitelist around the endorsement of instances you trust.
