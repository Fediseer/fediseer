This is a [FOSS service](https://github.com/db0/fediseer) to help Fediverse instances detect and avoid suspcicious instances

[Release Devlog](https://dbzer0.com/blog/overseer-a-fediverse-chain-of-trust/)

## Scope 

This Fediseer is focused around anti-spam verification. We make no judgement on the content of the guaranteed communities other than they have been verified to not be fake spam instances and are making a good effort to block spam accounts.

However using the endorsement system, you can create a further customized whitelist around the endorsement of instances you trust.
