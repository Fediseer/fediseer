"""The fediseer is a service for the fediverse which attempts to provide a crowdsourced human-curated spam/ham classification of fediverse instances as well as provide a public space to specify approval/disapproval of other instances.

In simple terms, using the fediseer, we attempt to figure out if an instance is spam or not through a human-driven system called the "chain of trust".

The three main concepts used in Fediseer are guarantees, endorsements and censures.

The fediseer provides a machine readable API to consume the data contained within.

        "document": 
"""Basically, any guaranteed instance is known as definitelly "not spam" (AKA "ham"). That doesn't mean any non-guaranteed instance is spam. Rather it is considered "unknown". The only reasoning to guarantee an instance is whether they are spam or not. The objective here being to prevent malicious actors from spawning an infinite amount of new instances on the fediverse to send spam.

Each instance can only be guaranteed by one instance and guarantee another instance. This is called the "chain of trust"

Guarantees are community driven. While the fediseer can guarantee at the top level as well, we hope that instance admins will guarantee the instances they know of and help ensure the health of the network.

        "document": 
"""Because each instance on the fediseer can guarantee and be guaranteed by a single instance, this causes a chain to form starting from the fediseer itself. Any instance guaranteed by such an unbroken chain is considered as ham. If the guarantee for any instance in this chain is revoked, the chain of trust is broken and any instances below are considered not-guaranteed.

This allows the fediseer to quickly deal with spam instances that sneaked into the fediseer and then guaranteed a bunch more of the spammy friends. As the chain can be revoked higher up, even a whole spam network can be countered by revoking the guarantee from the first spammer guaranteed.
