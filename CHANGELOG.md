# Changelog

# 0.10.0

Added `/api/v1/reports` endpoint which can show and filter recent actions on the fediseer

# 0.9.1

Added sysadmins and moderators count. This allows instance admins to self-report how many people they have in sysadmins positions and how many in moderator positions. This might be useful to find which instances might be lacking in support for their user-base.
