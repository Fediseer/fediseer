Allows instances to control the visibility of their endorsements, censures and hesitations by setting their visibility in PATCHing `api/b1/whitelist`
   * OPEN: Public visibility (Default).
   * ENDORSED: Only endorsed instances can see that list.
   * PRIVATE: Only admins from their own instance can see that list.

When a list visibility is not OPEN, the reports will use `[REDACTED]` as the target domain. But this will not affect historical reports.
