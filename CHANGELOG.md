# 0.16.0

Allows instances to control the visibility of their endorsements, censures and hesitations by setting their visibility in PATCHing `api/b1/whitelist`
   * OPEN: Public visibility (Default).
   * ENDORSED: Only endorsed instances can see that list.
   * PRIVATE: Only admins from their own instance can see that list.

When a list visibility is not OPEN, the reports will use `[REDACTED]` as the target domain. But this will not affect historical reports.

Added sysadmins and moderators count. This allows instance admins to self-report how many people they have in sysadmins positions and how many in moderator positions. This might be useful to find which instances might be lacking in support for their user-base.
